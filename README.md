# Fullstack
Full Stack Development with MEAN

#Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  Express HTML was fairly easy to use, there is a lot of support and documentation making this an easy language to work with overall. Javascript felt very familiar while I had never used it prior to this course It was very similar syntax wise compared to other languages I am used to such as Java.
  The SPA was the most difficult of the frontend development, I used Angular here and there was definitely a learning curve involved here. There was a lot more going on due to additional functionality over Express HTML while not feeling as familiar as Javascript did. This made this the most difficult 
  part of my frontend development, but once I got used to it I was starting to prefer it's use as it felt like I had more overall controll over my applications functionality. 
  
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  MongoDB offers a lot of flexibility do to it's document based approached. The support for MongoDB is ongoing with consistent updates even giving it similar functionality of SQL databases while maintaining the pro's of a NoSQL database. Since the database is being used to save trips the 
  document based setup of MongoDB makes a good choice for this application as well. 
  
#Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  JSON is a syntax opposed to a language like Javascript. JSON is usefull in standardizing the format of information between the frontend and backend of the application. This helps pass data back and forth without running into any issues or having to add additional code to handle types. 
  
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  One of the first examples of refactoring my code came when swapping my application over to using handlebars. This allowed me to reuse layouts for pages making it far easier when creating completely new pages. I no longer had to start from scratch just simply import in the specific format I wanted to use.

#Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  Methods for request and retrieval means being able to ask for and get specific information this is how the whole application works. Here I used HTML protocols such as GET and POST to communicate between my front end to my database to retrieve information and write to the database. Endpoints 
  refers to where the api fulfills a request. Finally security, for this application I created a login for authentication of a user for the admin SPA. This ensures that only admin are allowed on the SPA where changes to the application can be made. Security also incudes ensuring that your code itself is secure and that 
  the application works as it is specified as undefined behavior can create security risks. During development of this application I used Postman to test the API and ensure that my application acted as it was intended.
  
#Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
  This course gave me a lot of new experiences and a solid foundation in the MEAN stack. While there is still a lot I need to learn this course gave me a solid base to begin building on. More importantly it helped me get better
  at going through documentation to figure out how to implement a feature or to troubleshoot an issue. At the end of the day there is no way to know everything there is about software developement, but knowing how to find the answers you need
  when those questions arise is a valuable skill. This course also helped me clear up the connection between the front end, the logic, and the database. The closest I have currently come to creating a full application like this was for a mobile development course,
  and while I completed the course and my application I felt my logic between the database and the rest of the application was severely lacking. This course really helped clear this up and give me a bit more experience with this portion of the developement arguably one of the most 
  important.
